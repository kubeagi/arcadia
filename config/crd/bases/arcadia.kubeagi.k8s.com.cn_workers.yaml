                      populate the volume with data, if a non-empty volume is desired.
                      This may be any local object from a non-empty API group (non
                      core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field
                      is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                      the specified object matches some installed volume populator
                      or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality
                      of the DataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty,
                      they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility,
                      both fields (DataSource and DataSourceRef) will be set to the
                      same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other
                      is non-empty. There are two important differences between DataSource
                      and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource only allows two specific
                      types of objects, DataSourceRef allows any non-core object,
                      as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While DataSource
                      ignores disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves
                      all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                      specified. (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource
                      feature gate to be enabled.'

                      This field does not guarantee that the pod will be scheduled
                      on this node. Scheduler may decide to place the pod elsewhere
                      if other nodes become available sooner. Scheduler may also decide
                      to give the resources on this node to a higher priority pod
                      that is created after preemption. As a result, this field may
                      be different than PodSpec.nodeName when the pod is scheduled.

                      status arrays contain more detail about the pod's status. There
                      are five possible phase values: \n Pending: The pod has been
                      accepted by the Kubernetes system, but one or more of the container
                      images has not been created. This includes time before being
                      scheduled as well as time spent downloading images over the
                      network, which could take a while. Running: The pod has been
                      bound to a node, and all of the containers have been created.
                      At least one container is still running, or is in the process
                      of starting or restarting. Succeeded: All containers in the
                      pod have terminated in success, and will not be restarted. Failed:
                      All containers in the pod have terminated, and at least one
                      container has terminated in failure. The container either exited
                      with non-zero status or was terminated by the system. Unknown:
                      For some reason the state of the pod could not be obtained,
                      typically due to an error in communicating with the host of
                      the pod. \n More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#pod-phase"
